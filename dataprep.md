UTF-8 has an unfortunate property where there's freedom in the UTF-8 will write it different. Then, string-matching will match when flip. Two-entries in dictionaries with flipped may look the same.

The *.scp is short for script, because Dan Povey was educated in Cambrdige and not necessarily a shell script, but literally a script of things to do. The filename is order of.

If the command can go to standard out, then Kaldi will execute it.
